  <div class="homeParagraphBio">
    We look for candidates who share in the same values we have. Our employees value respect, are driven towards superior client satisfaction, seek excellence in all that they do, enjoy forming true partnerships with others in the industry, have sound economics in what they do, and enjoy serving the community.

    When I personally look for candidates, I look for people who are passionate about what they do, who want to keep learning and growing in their field, and who want to give back, not just to our customers, but to those they work with here at Sirius, as well as the community at large. Many of our senior level employees are published in the field, they speak at conferences, maybe even teach on the side. Our employees enjoy learning, as well as sharing their own knowledge, which makes for a collaborative and dynamic environment to be in.
